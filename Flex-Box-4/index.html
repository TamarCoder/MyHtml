                            <p>Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, this hostel has a
                                rich history tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach
                                inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying through the rugged terrain of
                                Snowdonia.
                                What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it
                                became a base for legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging
                                circuit of ridges—and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.

                                Hostel offers a glimpse into the grandeur of California's past. Originally the home of a
                                wealthy gold prospector, the mansion later became a boarding house and eventually a
                                hostel. Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows, carved wooden
                                staircases, and period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.

                            <p>Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped in history. Built in
                                the 19th century, the building was where Charles Dickens worked as a court reporter,
                                inspiring elements of his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a
                                magistrates' court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash. Today, the
                                hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can stay in refurbished prison cells and
                                relax in the courtroom-turned-lounge.</p>
